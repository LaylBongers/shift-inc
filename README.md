# Shift Inc
This project was my entry for Ludum Dare #35. The theme was "shapeshift". In
Shift Inc, you control a small army of nanobots in charge of shapeshifting the
host body you're injected into. Provide organic construction nanobots with the
proper resources in time, or be considered broken or obsolete and replaced.

Unfortunately this entry ended up being **unfinished** and **wasn't submitted
for judging**. This was mostly due to scope issues. The repository remains for
future reference and to show what you can do in Rust in a small amount of time.
