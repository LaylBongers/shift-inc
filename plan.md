# Day 3
- Require shapeshift construction bots to be built                              11:00 - 12:00
- Require the construction bots to be given food blobs                          12:00 - 13:00
- Make a bar tick down, requiring the player to deliver enough food blobs to    13:00 - 15:00
    shapeshift construction bots in time.

Low priority:
- Make robots collect floating blobs to storage if not needed elsewhere
- Start out with a material factory and have material be needed to do things
- Be able to build robot maintenance
- Robots need to repair in maintenance
- Have the factory produce material from food blobs
- Have an airlock for robots
- Body defense system
- Show blood vein.
- Require shapeshift construction bots to be able to move to blood vein
