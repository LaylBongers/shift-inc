Low priority:
- Make robots collect floating blobs to storage if not needed elsewhere
- Start out with a material factory and have material be needed to do things
- Be able to build robot maintenance
- Robots need to repair in maintenance
- Have the factory produce material from food blobs
- Have an airlock for robots
- Body defense system
